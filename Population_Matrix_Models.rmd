### Description

You will practice the process of constructing and manipulating 
a matrix model using R with the help of the R package popbio 
(Stubben and Milligan 2007). You will learn how to set up the 
population matrix, project population size in the future, and 
determine lambda, the stable stage distribution, and elasticities
for your matrix.
